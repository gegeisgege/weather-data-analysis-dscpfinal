[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/105q75B70m_qfZFpW3K_ZG2mH26_BKps2?authuser=0#scrollTo=24tFdRbMTBuQ)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes weather and air quality data from monitoring stations in Taiwan to identify pollution patterns and their relationships with meteorological conditions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze hourly patterns in air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO)
- Investigate relationships between temperature/humidity and air quality
- Compare air quality across different monitoring stations
- Provide insights for public health awareness

## 📈 Key Findings
1. **Peak Pollution Hours**: Pollution peaks during morning (7-9 AM) and evening (6-8 PM) rush hours
2. **Temperature Effect**: Higher temperatures correlate with lower PM2.5 levels
3. **Station Variability**: Significant differences between urban and rural monitoring stations
4. **Health Impact**: X% of hours exceed WHO air quality guidelines
